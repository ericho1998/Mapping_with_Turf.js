# Spatial Querying
### Using Turf.js to introduce spatial queries for Javascript
### Made for ENGO 551 Lab 4

## Features:
- The map loaded by Mapbox GL will contain markers for schools (book symbols) and clinics/hospitals (medical cross symbols).
- Hovering over any marker will show the name of the location, and the type of school, clinic or hospital.
- Clicking on any school will activate Turf, which will use spatial querying to find the nearest hospital/clinic to it.
- The nearest clinic or hospital will generate an orange (subject to change) marker around it, to signify that it is the closest.
